# Generic ordered fragment-family discovery.
#
# A family is an arbitrary directory whose files form one ordered input stream
# for a consumer. Dot core owns only the structural policy:
#
#   - direct files aggregate
#   - an immediate <name>.replace/ directory contributes only its last lexical
#     file, making that directory a mutually-exclusive group
#   - the final stream is sorted by relative path
#
# Consumers own file format, validation, merge semantics, and output targets.

# Return whether a path is a real fragment file.
#
# Family discovery is intentionally conservative about editor artifacts and
# dotfiles because these directories are shared by humans, overlays, and
# generated tooling. A stray swap file should never become config input during
# `dot update`, and hidden files are reserved for tooling metadata rather than
# user-authored merge fragments.

# Args: $1 = candidate path
# Returns 0 when the path is a consumable file, 1 otherwise.

  # is therefore equivalent to basename here, without starting a process for
  # every fragment considered during each convergence run.
